	\section*{Question 1 (40 points): Political Science}
		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

\newpage
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 \\
		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
	\vspace{7cm}
	\noindent First, the totals of each column and row was created, with an overall total being recorded also
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c c}
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning & Sum \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 & 27 \\
			Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 & 15 \\
			Sum & 21 & 13 & 8 & 42 \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	\noindent After this, the expected values were then calculated, as shown in the following table: \\
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class & 14(13.5) & 6(8.36) & 7(5.14) \\
			Lower class & 7(7.5) & 7(4.64) & 1(2.86) \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	\noindent The degrees of freedom was then found, using the formula (1- number of columns)(1 - number of rows), which was 2. Using the formula, the test statistic was then calculated, with $\chi^2$ = 3.80352207. This calculation was also checked against the 'chisq()' function in R, which gave the following output: \\
	\begin{verbatim}
		X-squared = 3.7912, df = 2, p-value = 0.1502
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = 0.1$?\\
	\noindent Using the following code, the following p-value was produced:
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=26, lastline=27]{PS02_answers/code.R}
	\begin{verbatim}
		[1] 0.1493129
	\end{verbatim}
	\noindent With the p-value being greater than .10, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was no significant difference between the likelihood of a bribe being solicited depending on whether the drivers were in the upper or lower-class groups.
	\newpage
	\item [(c)] Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class & 0.322 & -1.643 & 1.526 \\
			\\
			Lower class & -0.322 & 1.644  & -1.525  \\
			
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	
	\vspace{7cm}
	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?  \\
	\noindent Standardised residuals help to interpret the results as it normalises the observed residuals. This means that the residuals are converted to Z scores, where it can be easily observed above that all values fall in the interval -2 $\le$ Z $\le$ 2, as any score outside this interval would be determined as significant.
	
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2 (40 points): Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

\end{figure}		

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. \\ 
		\noindent H0 = There is no linear relationship between whether a village's GP had a reserved position and the number of repaired or new drinking water facilities.   \\
		\noindent H1 = There is a linear relationship between whether a village's GP had a reserved position and the number of repaired or new drinking water facilities. 
	\vspace{6cm}
	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).
	\noindent The following code was used to run the regression:
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=12, lastline=13]{PS02_answers/part2.R}
	\noindent From this, the following output was created
	\begin{verbatim}
		Residuals:
		Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
		-23.991 -14.738  -7.865   2.262 316.009 
		
		Coefficients:
		Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
		(Intercept)   14.738      2.286   6.446 4.22e-10 ***
		reserved1      9.252      3.948   2.344   0.0197 *  
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
		
		Residual standard error: 33.45 on 320 degrees of freedom
		Multiple R-squared:  0.01688,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.0138 
		F-statistic: 5.493 on 1 and 320 DF,  p-value: 0.0197
	\end{verbatim}
	

	\vspace{6cm}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. \\

	\noindent The equation created from running this regression analysis is as follows: \\
	
	\noindent \textit{Yi} = 14.738 + 9.5252\textit{Xi} \\
	
	\noindent This means that the model predicts that for every value increased in X, there is an increase of around 9.5 improved or new drinking water facilities
	\noindent However, the insignificant p-value means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that no linear relationship was found between villages whose GPs had a reserved leadership position and GPs who had no reserved positions. The R Squared is also low at 0.017, meaning that the model only explained around 1.7 \% of the variance in the output variable. This implies that the reservation policy was not related to an increase in new or repaired drinkning water facilities.
